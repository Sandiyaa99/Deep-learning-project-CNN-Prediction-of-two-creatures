# Deep-learning-project-CNN-Prediction-of-two-creatures
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a deep learning algorithm where it is able to differentiate one object from the other.
The CNN follows,
step1:Convolution
step2:Max Pooling
step3:Flattening
step4:Full connection
In this prediction of two creatures,the data is preprocessed,the CNN model is built,trained and a single prediction is made.
